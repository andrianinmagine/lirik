I was a foolish little child, Crazy things I used to do
And all the pain I put you through, Mama now I`m here for you
For all the times I made you cry, The days I told you lies
Now its time for you to rise,For all the things you sacrificed

Ooh

If I could turn back time, rewind
If I could make it undone I swear that I would
I would make it up to you

(Ooh

If I could turn back time, rewind
If I could make it undone I swear that I would
I would make it up to you)
Mom, Im all grown up now
Its a brand new day
Id like to put a smile (on your )face everyday
Mom, Im all grown up now
And its not too late
Id like to put a smile on your face everyday
You know you are the number one for me
You know you are the number one for me
You know you are the number one for me
Oh oh
Number one for me
Now I finally understand, That famous line
About the day Id face in time, Cause now I've got a child of mine
Even though I was so bad, I've learnt so much from you
Now Im trying to do it too, Love my kids the way you do
Ooh
If I could turn back time, rewind
If I could make it undone I swear that I would
I would make it up to you
(Ooh
If I could turn back time, rewind
If I could make it undone I swear that I would
I would make it up to you)
Mom Im all grown up now
Its a brand new day
Id like to put a smile on your face everyday
Mom Im all grown up now
And its not too late
Id like to put a smile( on your )face everyday
You know you are the number one for me
You know you are the number one for me
You know you are the number one for me
Oh oh
number one for me
You know you are the number one for me
You know you are the number one for me
You know you are the number one for...
There is no one in this world
That can take your place
Ooh, Im sorry for ever taken you for granted
Ooh, I will use every chance I get
To make you smile
Whenever Im around you
Now I will to try to love you
Like you love me
Only God knows how much you mean to me
Ooh
If I could turn back time, rewind
If I could make it undone I swear that I would
I would make it up to you

(If I could turn back time, rewind
If I could make it undone I swear that I would
I would make it up to you)
Mom I`m all grown up now
Its a brand new day
Id like to put a smile on your face everyday
Mom I`m all grown up now
And its not too late
Id like to put a smile on your face everyday
Mom I`m all grown up now
Its a brand new day
Id like to put a smile (on your) face everyday
Mom I`m all grown up now
And its not too late
Id like to put a smile (on your )face everyday
The number one for me
The number one for me
The number one for me
Oh oh, number one for me
